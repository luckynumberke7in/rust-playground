### In this leg of the project, I will be locally running [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings).

### When I complete a lesson / .rs file, I will post the working file to /completed_exercises folder.

### You can find the original lessons in the [exercises](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/tree/main/exercises) folder in rustlings.
