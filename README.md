## This repo is for the purposes of mastering Git while learning Rust & Leptos (Rust web dev framework similar to Solid JS).

#### I'll be doing the Rustlings project found [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) (exercises designed to augment the Rust [Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/))

#### Also, journeying into the depths of Rust / WASM and web dev via [Leptos](https://leptos.dev/) & [Guide](https://leptos-rs.github.io/leptos/01_introduction.html)

#### I plan to make 1 main branch, and 1 dev branch per scope of work.

#### This will allow me to play around with commits and test some of the complexities of git / github.
